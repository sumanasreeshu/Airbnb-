**Exploratory Data Analysis**

- Neighborhood Distribution: Manhattan has the highest number of listings, but budget-friendly options are mainly found in Staten Island and the Bronx.

- Room Type Analysis: Entire homes/apartments command higher prices (~$200 on average) than private rooms ($100) and shared rooms ($50)
- Top Neighborhoods by Price: Tribeca and Battery Park City lead in high-end pricing.

**Key Insights**

Manhattan dominates in pricing, with an average near $200, while Staten Island offers the most affordable options.
Entire homes/apartments are priced the highest due to their premium on privacy and space, while shared rooms offer budget-friendly options for group travelers.

**Business Recommendations**

- Increase Budget-Friendly Listings: Encourage more shared and private room options to attract budget-conscious travelers.

- Implement Dynamic Pricing: Use dynamic pricing strategies in high-demand areas like Manhattan during off-peak seasons to increase bookings.

- Promote Affordable Neighborhoods: Highlight areas like Staten Island, Bronx, and Queens as budget-friendly alternatives.
- Introduce Mid-Tier Options: Offer studio apartments to fill the gap between private rooms and entire homes.
