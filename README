NYC Airbnb Data Analysis
Project Overview
This project offers a comprehensive analysis of Airbnb listings in New York City, using the "New York City Airbnb Open Data" (AB_NYC_2019) dataset. The main goal is to uncover pricing trends, neighborhood popularity, and customer preferences to help refine Airbnb's pricing strategies and improve their market positioning in NYC.

Project Highlights
Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values and standardized variables to ensure consistency. Key fields with missing information were carefully imputed to avoid skewing the analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified pricing patterns across different neighborhoods and room types, highlighting both high-demand areas and budget-friendly options.
Key Insights:
Neighborhood Analysis: Manhattan listings dominate in price, averaging around $200, while Staten Island offers the most budget-friendly options.
Room Type Trends: Entire homes/apartments command higher prices (~$200 on average) compared to private rooms ($100) and shared rooms ($50), reflecting the premium for privacy and space.
Top Expensive Neighborhoods: High-end neighborhoods like Tribeca and Battery Park City show significantly higher price points.
Business Recommendations
Expand Budget-Friendly Options: Increasing listings for shared and private rooms can attract budget-conscious travelers.
Implement Dynamic Pricing: Optimizing prices in Manhattan and during off-peak seasons could increase bookings for premium listings.
Promote Affordable Neighborhoods: Boosting visibility for areas like Staten Island, Bronx, and Queens could attract a more diverse customer base.
Highlight Mid-Tier Options: Introducing more studio apartments or similar mid-priced options can bridge the gap between private rooms and entire homes.
